# Jeopardy Game Interview Assignment

### Goal:
The goal is to spend (up to) 4 hours to create a simple interpretation of the [Jeopardy game board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeopardy!). What we are looking for is best practices in modern web development in all areas (scripting, HTML, and CSS), good use of the Vue framework and its features, as well as your creativity and problem-solving. The preferred tech stack is Vue, but you can use the ones you are most comfortable with.

There is no expectation to have a perfect, beautiful app constructed. However, the app should run! Do the best you can, have fun, and please feel free to reach out with any questions you may have.
